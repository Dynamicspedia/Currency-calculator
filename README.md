Currency Calculator for Microsoft Dynamics AX

The Currency calculator is a tool for calculating amounts between currencies which uses the rates as setup in the Exchange rates of Microsoft Dynamics AX.

Sometimes I was in the need of converting amounts between different currencies while using the setup of the Exchange rates in AX. I decided to create a simple form to do this for me.

Downloads for both Microoft Dynamics AX 2009 and AX 2012 are available. The AX 2012 version can be used for all AX 2012 versions.

A menu item to run the form is added to the Global tools menu.
